# David Clark

I became interested in coding through self-study of online MIT courses. After years of tinkering with some personal projects and finding ways to automate parts of my legal work as an attorney, I decided to make the leap to a new career in tech though Nashville Software School. Iâ€™m someone who is naturally curious and who takes pride in continuing to learn. Through NSS, I was able to further explore my passion for technology and develop those skills to solve complex business problems.

I am currently looking for a position as an Entry-Level Software Developer. If you have openings, please reach out.

### Nashville Kennels
For this group project, we had to work within an established codebase. We gained good experience reading and understanding someone else's code and working with established functionality to extend features and fix bugs.
